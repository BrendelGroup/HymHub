# HymHub is now GenHub

HymHub has now been superceded by [GenHub](https://standage.github.io/genhub).

------

The following is the original description of HymHub.

> HymHub is a data resource supporting comparative genomics research with a focus on social insects, their solitary relatives, and important outgroups.
> The purpose of HymHub is to facilitate genome analysis by gathering data from disparate sources, consolidating it into a consistent and easily digestible format, and providing basic templates for exploratory data analysis with popular software packages such as R and Python.

As time went on, we needed a more robust and generalized solution for this problem.
HymHub's social insect branding became inappropriate as we started incorporating data from plants and vertebrates, and continuing to issue post updates to the processed data sets to fig**share** has become untenable.
We have focused instead on making the software used to create the data sets more robust, generic, and easy to obtain and run.

We have retained the legacy HymHub code in the `legacy` branch.
The HymHub website setup is still available in the `gh-pages` branch, although the home page redirects to this source code repository.
