# HymHub

**[HymHub](http://brendelgroup.github.io/HymHub)** is a data resource supporting comparative genomics research with a focus on social insects, their solitary relatives, and important outgroups.
The purpose of HymHub is to facilitate genome analysis by gathering data from disparate sources, consolidating it into a consistent and easily digestible format, and provide basic templates for exploratory data analysis with popular software packages such as R and Python.

We created HymHub primarily to support our own research efforts and facilitate others in reproducing and building on our work.
However, we also hope that sharing this resource will provide a model that encourages others to take the principles of reproducibility and transparency seriously, for the benefit of their own research and the community at large.

## Quick overview

* Cleaned up data files--including genome sequences, annotations, and summary data tables--are hosted on fig**share**.
* The code used to download and clean up the data files is hosted on GitHub. With a couple of software prerequisites installed, anyone should be able to automatically rebuild the "official" data files on their own local system.
* IPython notebooks and Rmd files are available both from fig**share** and GitHub. These provide narrated demos for analyzing the data that users can easily and interactively edit for their own research activities.
