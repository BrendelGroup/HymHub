After several months of work, HymHub Release v0.1.0 is now available.
The primary changes in this release are described below.

* Genomes for 3 additional ant species, *Atta cephalotes*, *Acromyrmex echinatior*, and *Pogonomyrmex barbatus*, have been integrated.
* Since annotated genomes for all HymHub species are now available from NCBI, we have discontinued used of HymenopteraBase genomes.
  The code for downloading and formatting HymenopteraBase data is now deprecated, and will be completely removed in a future release.
* This release incorporates work related to identifying homologous iLoci (hiLoci).
