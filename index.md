**[HymHub]({{ site.url }})** is a data resource supporting comparative genomics research with a focus on social insects, their solitary relatives, and important outgroups.
The purpose of HymHub is to facilitate genome analysis by gathering data from disparate sources, consolidating it into a consistent and easily digestible format, and provide basic templates for exploratory data analysis with popular software packages such as R and Python.

## What can I do with HymHub?

* Go to fig**share** (link coming soon) to download genome sequences (Fasta), annotations (GFF3), and summary data tables (TSV) for all sequenced Hymenopteran genomes.
* Go to [GitHub](http://github.com/BrendelGroup/HymHub) to download the code we used to build these data files and construct them yourself on your local computer.
* Check out our [interactive IPython notebooks and Rmd files](link coming soon) for tips to get started analyzing the data.
* Use our [GitHub issue tracker](http://github.com/BrendelGroup/HymHub/issues) to tell us about any issues with the data or our code.
