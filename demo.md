{% include JB/setup %}

HymHub provides a data analysis demo for those who are interested in analyzing the data but may not have much experience with data analysis software.
This demo doesn't do anything particularly interesting from a data analysis perspective, but it provides an example of how to load HymHub data into popular statistics packages and how to pull out data of interest for analysis.

The demo is available in 2 flavors, Python and R.
Both flavors are available in a static (web read-only) version and a downloadable interactive version.
Note that running the interactive version on your computer requires downloading the HymHub data and installing [IPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html) or [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com), depending on your flavor of choice.
